### Goal

The goal of this project was to apply the MVP Android Architecture, SOLID principles, and software
design-patterns to create an android app that is easy to **maintain, modify, and extend.**
Each module was carefully designed and implemented to minimize dependencies and coupling between classes, and to
increase the overall legibility, cohesion, and extensibility
