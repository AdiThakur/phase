### Goal

In teams of 5, we were challenged to create an Android app that is easy to **maintain, modify, and extend.** To achieve this goal, our team applied the MVP Android Architecture, SOLID principles, and software design-patterns. Each module was carefully designed and implemented to minimize dependencies and coupling between classes, and to increase the overall legibility, cohesion, and extensibility. The end result was a **modular** app in which we could easily **replace any working part**, ranging from something as significant as the GUI, or the data model, to something as small but crucial as the logic that drives the A.I in the mini-games within the app.
